 abstract = {The problem of evaluating the goodness of statistical models is investigated from an information-theoretic point of view. Information criteria are proposed for evaluating models constructed by various estimation procedures when the specified family of probability distributions does not contain the distribution generating the data. The proposed criteria are applied to the evaluation of models estimated by maximum likelihood, robust, penalised likelihood, Bayes procedures, etc. We also discuss the use of the bootstrap in model evaluation problems and present a variance reduction technique in the bootstrap simulation.},

@article{Varin2005,
 abstract = {A composite likelihood consists of a combination of valid likelihood objects, usually related to small subsets of data. The merit of composite likelihood is to reduce the computational complexity so that it is possible to deal with large datasets and very complex models, even when the use of standard likelihood or Bayesian methods is not feasible. In this paper, we aim to suggest an integrated, general approach to inference and model selection using composite likelihood methods. In particular, we introduce an information criterion for model selection based on composite likelihood. We also describe applications to the modelling of time series of counts through dynamic generalised linear models and to the analysis of the well-known Old Faithful geyser dataset.},
